    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is a 2025 Metroidvania video game developed and published by Australian independent developer Team Cherry. The sequel to Hollow Knight (2017), it was released on 4 September 2025 for Linux, macOS, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
    <p>Silksong's story follows Hallownest's former princess-protector, Hornet, after she is captured and transported to the unfamiliar land of Pharloom. Gameplay sees the player navigating through the large, interconnected areas of this kingdom, where they must battle enemies, traverse platforming challenges, and complete quests using various skills, tools, and movement mechanics. Originally planned as downloadable content for Hollow Knight, the project grew in scope over time, prompting Team Cherry to announce in February 2019 that it would instead become a full standalone sequel.</p>
    <p>The game received critical acclaim for its graphics, soundtrack, story, world design, and gameplay, though opinions on its high difficulty were mixed. Within its first three days of release, it had over 5 million players, including 1 million playing with Xbox Game Pass and 3 million with Steam.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong's gameplay is similar to its predecessor Hollow Knight, featuring 2D platforming and combat. Some changes are made from the original, such as the player character moving more acrobatically and healing faster. Side-quests (called "Wishes") are part of the game and are tracked in a journal. These quests are provided by the non-player characters or found at quest boards.</p>
    <p>The game also features "Tools" that require in-game currency (called "shell shards") to create. Tools are divided into three categories: blue Tools and yellow Tools, which are both support-oriented, and the typically offensive red Tools, which have limited uses and must be manually activated. Hornet is limited in how many Tools of each colour she can wear, with her maximum capacity modified when changing between different gameplay styles, known as "Crests". In addition to their varying tool makeups, the speed and range of Hornet’s attacks also differ between Crests. Each Crest also possesses a unique mechanic, such as boosting damage dealt if hits are avoided or allowing for tools to be replenished without resting at a bench.</p>
    <p>When attacking enemies or interacting with certain objects and locations, Hornet adds "Silk" to her reservoir. Silk can be used for healing, with three hit points recovered in a single heal. Silk can also be expended to use "Silk Skills", additional attacks which are unlocked by locating remnants of the Weavers and their society when progressing through the game. Tools, Crests and Silk Skills can be adjusted when sitting at Benches, which also serve as a source of healing and act as respawn points after all hit points are lost.</p>

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Silksong takes place after the events of Hollow Knight and continues the story of Hornet in the kingdom of Pharloom. Pharloom is a ruined religious kingdom afflicted by the "Haunting" - a Silk-based madness that afflicts bugs and reanimates their bodies. Hornet, a descendant of the Weavers—an advanced Silk-manipulating species—is captured by a group of veiled bugs[a] to be brought to Pharloom. There, she discovers her connections to the kingdom, travelling across the land, encountering its Haunted inhabitants, and helping other bugs that have escaped the Haunting to fulfill their wishes and restore the kingdom.</p>
    <p>Hornet escapes her captors and falls into the Moss Grotto. She finds that her captors were adherents of the Citadel, a supposedly holy institution located at Pharloom's summit that attracts numerous pilgrims. Hornet decides to ascend to the Citadel to uncover the reason behind her capture. Throughout her journey, Hornet encounters the remnants of the Weavers and binds their power, while meeting pilgrims, Pharloom's residents, and travelers from other lands. She also encounters Lace, a being composed entirely of Silk who taunts Hornet throughout her journey.</p>
    <p>As the game progresses, it is revealed that the Weavers were spider-like bugs evolved by Grand Mother Silk, a godlike being. Initially believing her to be their mother, they served Grand Mother Silk before rebelling upon discovering the truth. The Weavers contained her within the Cradle—a structure atop the Citadel—but over time she was able to exert her influence on other bugs, causing the Haunting. Some of the Weavers left Pharloom for the kingdom of Hallownest, giving birth to Hornet.</p>
